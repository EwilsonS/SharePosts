<p>This is a simple social network built using my [MVC framework for PHP](https://github.com/EwilsonS/wilsonmvcphp)</p>
<p>All forms are **validated** and **sanitized** to prevent harmful scripts</p>
<p>Form fields use flash messages to alert the user of any errors
<p>Only logged in users may see/add/edit posts</p>
